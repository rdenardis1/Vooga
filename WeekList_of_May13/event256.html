This is the primary service for Duke students. The York Room is located in Gray building on the second floor of the Divinity School Library. It is accessible by entering the Divinity School Library from the first floor, or from a separate entry on the second floor. After prayer services, the community gathers together to socialize over lunch offered by Muslim Life at Duke. Jummah on West is a wonderful way to catch up with friends and meet new members to the Duke Muslim community.

Jummah at Duke North Hospital, too:

Jummah is held every Friday at 1:30 PM throughout the "entire year" in the Sixth Floor Chapel at Duke Hospital North. This service serves as an alternate to the one on West for those who cannot make the 12:45 time or for those who work or study closer to the hospital.</p></body></html>
