With little hope of returning to Bhutan or being welcomed as citizens of Nepal, refugees from the camps in Damak confront resettlement to third countries. Within this context of insecurity and uncertainty, they have created lives filled with beauty, work, leisure, school, worship, family, and friends.

The exhibit is part of the Kenan Institute's Bhutanese Resettlement Project, a multi-site community-based research project in eastern Nepal and Durham exploring the effects of resettlement upon Bhutanese refugees.</p></body></html>
